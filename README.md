# portfolio-site-mail-api

In this repro I implemented a sendGrid api: With this I can send mail via my portfolio-site.

As a second step I modified the code so that can use it in Firebase Functions.


This repro is going to be obsolete as it will be migrated to the portfolio-site repro so that everything is together on one place. 
I will keep this repro make the history visible but will let it unchanged from now on
